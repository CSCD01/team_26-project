Comments:

I was very happy to see that the team came fully prepared to deliver a
professional presentation. Every team member seemed to be well
informed and actively participated in the interview.

The team introduction was done well, in a professional manner. 

The project was introduced well, including a good demonstration.

The reasons for selecting the project were presented well.

Process: As we have discussed, I would be happy to replace this part
of the interview grade with what you achieve in the second interview.
I also suggest you prepare to make sure all team members are equally
prepared to present / answer questions about the software process.
