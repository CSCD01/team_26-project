CSC D01 Deliverable #3 Marking Rubric

40/45

__10_ / 10  (5 marks per issue) DETAILED issue descriptions for both issues considered, including UML diagrams, code traces, etc.


__9_ / 10  Report on reasons for selecting the issue to implement, including
DETAILED implementation plans.

Better to mark (ie. by color) which part is modified/newly added in your UML

_5__ / 5 A complete and comprehensive acceptance test suite for the selected issue.

_6__ / 10  Architecture document. Now that we know more about architecture, we expect a more informed analysis. Among other aspects, the following should be discussed:
-- architectural style; architectural pattern if applicable
-- description of all components
-- description of interfaces between components
-- discussion of level of coupling between components
-- discussion of cohesion of components
-- how are each of the following addressed with architectural choices (if applicable)
   -- performance
   -- security
   -- safety
   -- availability
   -- maintainability


The UMLs with few lines of comments is not enough at this stage, though it does show some interesting patterns/choices. Expect more comments about architectural choice, architectural pattern, etc.

__10_ / 10 Presentation and Quality of Writing. Same criteria as before.
